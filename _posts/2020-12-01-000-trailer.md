# Show Notes

Hi everyone and welcome to the Developers Bakery ðŸ‘‹

A podcast about open-source projects, tools and libraries for software developers.

If you ever developed any kind of software, you probably know that a significant amount of code is not the one you wrote but the one others wrote. Frameworks, Libraries and SDKs are the building blocks to write great software for our end users. It's just unthinkable to reinvent the wheel every time, right?

In this show we will meet authors and maintainers of libraries that are used worldwide to bake great software every day. We will hear stories from the open source community and learn what is happening behind the scenes of famous tools and projects.

My name is Nicola Corti and I'll be your host for this show.

Make sure you subscribe to the podcast on either Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts or directly from the website thebakery.dev. To be notified of the latest episodes, you can follow the show as [@thebakerydev](https://twitter.com/thebakerydev) on twitter.
