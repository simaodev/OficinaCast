In this episode, we shift a bit from Mobile & Kotlin to talk about shells, prompts and Rust! ü¶Ä

Today we have Matan Kushner with us on stage to talk about [Starship üöÄ](https://github.com/starship/starship). From their website: _The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable **prompt** for any shell!_
